! Integration of hydrodynamic forces and moments on overset surfaces.
! USURP was inspired by Larry Wigton's presentation of "Polymixsur" 
! at the 7th Overset Symposium in Huntingdon Beach, CA in 2004.
! USURP also relies on the General Polygon Clipping library (Version 2.32)
! by Alan Murta for polygon Boolean operations and triangulation and
! "Triangle" (Version 1.6) by Jonathan Shewchuk for triangulation.
! Note that Triangle is freely available but copyrighted by its author,
! Jonathan Shewchuk, and may not be sold or included in commercial products
! without a license.  Similarly, the GPC library is free for non-commerical
! use.  Anyone wishing to use the GPC library in support of a commercial
! product should email gpc@cs.man.ac.uk.
!
! USURP calls the gpc and Triangle libraries via "translator" routines, one in
! Fortran that wraps the subject and clipping polygon structures into
! an integer array and float array of fixed length, and a second in
! c that takes these arrays, converts them back into polygon structures,
! and calls the c libraries.  These routines also handle the information
! moving in the other direction.  The calls could be made from 
! Fortran to the c libraries directly, but this would involve Fortran 
! descriptors, and the resulting code would not be portable.
